Alan Turing and his Contemporaries: Building the World's First Computers
Abstract
To mark the centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, the British Computer Society 
has published a book written by members of the Computer Conservation Society.
The book examines Alan Turing's contribution to the implementation of practical 
stored-program digital computers and the relation between Turing and the other 
computer pioneers active in the period 1945â€“55. In this invited article,
the book's Editor gives an overall view of the subject, focussing particularly
on Alan Turing's special contributions in the first decade of the Information Age.
